WordQuiz is the first version of a vocabulary and language-learning program
under development by Alex Zirbel.

WordQuiz uses QT as a GUI helper with C++ to maintain lists of user-added words
and includes options for the user to quiz themselves on the lists of words.  It
also keeps track of the user's mastery of each word in the list.

Thanks to Craig Zirbel for the inspiration for this project, and for early
implementations!
