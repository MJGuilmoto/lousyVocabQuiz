Welcome to WordQuiz!

This project was created by Alex Zirbel as a tool for learning languages,
especially vocabulary - but is meant to be built into a larger open-source
language tutor program.

New to the project?  Check out the Doxygen documentation to get your
feet on the ground in terms of project organization. Install doxygen, then run it with:

This project uses QT for GUI, Boost for backend help, and
Doxygen for documentation.
