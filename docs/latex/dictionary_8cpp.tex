\subsection{Detailed Description}
A class to keep track of a list of words and their translations. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}

The dictionary class contains functions to load, and eventually edit and save, word lists. It loads the lists into a bidirectional map (boost::bimap) and stores them in an iterable way.

\begin{Desc}
\item[\hyperlink{todo__todo000001}{Todo}]make this an interface, and then implement it with two types: 1. CustomDictionary doens't worry about any error checking, syncing, word lists, or language-\/specific stuff. 2. StandardDictionary makes sure that all the words for a particular language are consistent, tries to help with style, etc. \end{Desc}
