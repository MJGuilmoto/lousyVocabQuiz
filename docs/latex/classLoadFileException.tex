{\ttfamily \#include $<$exceptions.h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
A file including definitons for multiple exceptions the program can throw.

All exceptions extend std::exception. Exceptions are used to stop the program in case of failure, but also provide easy error messages and allow higher parts of the program to catch the exception and handle it without crashing outright. Handles all bad file readings. This is the best way to show that a constructor failed, which may be the case when loading dictionaries. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
exceptions.h\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
