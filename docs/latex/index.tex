Welcome to WordQuiz! This software is intended as the first attempt of language-\/learning software meant to expand on vocabulary-\/learning programs by catering the words presented to individual users.\hypertarget{index_organization_sec}{}\section{Organization and Tools}\label{index_organization_sec}
WordQuiz is built on QT for all GUI elements, so I recommend installing QT Creator for help with building on your platform. WordQuiz also uses Boost, extra libraries for C++, which will need to be installed. Finally, this documentation is thanks to Doxygen, which automatically generates documentation based on inline code comments.\hypertarget{index_licensing_sec}{}\section{Licensing and joining this project}\label{index_licensing_sec}
WordQuiz is open source under the GNU General Public License. Since it's still young, I haven't looked into licensing very far yet, but I would like to retrain rights as original creator of the project while allowing other people to download, build on, and improve this software. If you would like contribute to the official version of this project, please contact me.
